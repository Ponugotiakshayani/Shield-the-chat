# Shield-the-chat
The "Shield-the-chat" project aims to enhance digital privacy through a secure chat application featuring two-factor authentication (2FA). By requiring users to authenticate via both password and QR code scanning, the system ensures only authorized individuals can participate in conversations, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
